## The Challenge

- A bitmap image can be represented as a matrix of dimensions M x N, where each position of the matrix can assume an integer value within a range. Build an algorithm that receives as input Vector A [N] where An {0, 1, 2, ..., 15}. The output of your algorithm must be a String indicating the number of times each An was found in the bitmap array. In the event that an element has not been found, the algorithm must return that the quantity is zero for that element. The format of the String is free.

- Transform the previous algorithm into a Rest API. You will receive as a parameter a list with the values ​​of An and should return the algorithm output in JSON format.

- Given the log of the first Superhero race - Around the World, develop an API that reads the log file above and returns the following information: Arrival Position, Superhero Code, Superhero Name, Number of Spins Completed and Total Test Time.
